# Design Patterns with Python
Design patterns are the best-formalized practices a programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

### Types of design patterns
- Creational - designed for object creation to increase flexibility and reuse of existing code. Polymorphism is used.
- Structural - establishes a relationship between classes making larger structures. Inheritance is used. Whenever you think of designing architecture for your system, structural design patterns help you to plan for the future, and arrange classes in neat hierarchies.
- Behavioral - effective communications and interactions between objects/classes. Methods are used.

### Using common design patterns, you can:
- Speed up the development process;
- Reduce the number of lines of code;
- Make sure your code is well-designed;
- Anticipate future problems arising from small issues.
